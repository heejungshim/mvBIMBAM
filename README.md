## mvBIMBAM

This repository contains a software mvBIMBAM, a version of [BIMBAM](http://www.haplotype.org/bimbam.html) for multivariate association analysis, implementing a Bayesian approach for genetic association analysis of multiple related phenotypes.

We adapted source codes in [BIMBAM](http://www.haplotype.org/bimbam.html) to deal with multiple related phenotypes.

## Binary executable file

Binary executable file for Linux is in the `mvBIMBAM/bin/` directory (complied on 06/17/2014).

A zip file of binary executable file, source code, and example input files for MAC is in `mvBIMBAM\forMAC` directory (tested on OS 10.6, but should also work under other 10.x)

## Installation

cd into the `mvBIMBAM/` directory

    make all

Then, binary executable file will be created in the `mvBIMBAM/` directory.

## User manual 

User manual is in the `mvBIMBAM/doc/` directory.
